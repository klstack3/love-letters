You are my technical pair for a creative data-visualization web app called **Love Letters**.

**Goal**
Create a minimalist, visually stunning 3D globe map showing the flight routes between two people.  
Each route is manually defined.  
The app should look like a work of digital art—opaque in meaning, but visually captivating.  

**Visual + Interaction Requirements**
- Background: deep, rich black.
- Routes: luminous, curved great-circle or Bezier arcs with shimmery gradients (violet → cyan, or magenta → blue).  
  Slight motion or pulse along the gradient to show direction.
- Starting points: **tiny glowing dots**—one **deep green**, one **light pink**.
- Meetup points: a **small golden envelope icon with a heart**, softly shimmering (SVG or Lottie).
- Globe interaction: users can **zoom, pan, and rotate** freely.
- Hovering over a route or point shows a subtle tooltip with the **date** of travel.
- No explanatory text beyond the title “Love Letters”.  
  The visualization should feel private and poetic.

**Tech Stack**
- **React + Vite + TypeScript**
- **Mapbox GL JS** or **Deck.gl + Maplibre** (whichever supports smooth WebGL gradients)
- **TailwindCSS** for minimal non-map styling
- Optional enhancement: **three.js layer** or **particles.js** for faint background shimmer

Implementation Tasks

Scaffold project:

npm create vite@latest love-letters --template react-ts

Install mapbox-gl, react-map-gl, tailwindcss, postcss, autoprefixer

Configure Tailwind.

Create src/components/Globe.tsx to render the map.

Load data from routes.json.

Draw glowing arcs for each route with gradient materials.

Place small pink/green origin dots and golden envelope icons for meetups.

Add hover tooltips for dates using Mapbox popups.

Add smooth camera motion and subtle particle shimmer overlay.

Responsive full-screen view; remove all map UI chrome except zoom/rotate.

Include a minimal title overlay “Love Letters” in faint white text (bottom corner).

Add an export option (optional): capture screenshot via html2canvas or three.js render target.

Deliverables

A complete, runnable repo structure with all dependencies and starter code.

Ready to open in VS Code or Replit and preview in browser via npm run dev.
